# puppy.run

A website that shows what I've been up to recently.

Basically, it has pages for:

* live streams (Twitch + YouTube + Hitbox)
* most recent significant code-related things (e.g. new releases)
* most recent Bandcamp album + most recent SoundCloud song

The homepage shows the most recent of those three pages.
